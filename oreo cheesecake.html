        <h3> Instructions:</h3>

    <div class="paragraph2">
        <ol>
            <p> To make the base:</p>
            <li>Melt the butter in shorts bursts. If you're like me and don't want to clean extra dishes, pop it in the microwave but make sure the bowl is covered so the butter doesn't splat everywhere.</li>
            <li>Crush the biscuits. You can use a food processor to make life easy but if you don't have that, use anything in your kitchen such as a rolling pin or potatoe masher to crush the biscuits in a bowl or bag. </li>
            <li>Add the melted butter into the crushed biscuits and mix it well. Once done tip it into a 8" springfoam pan and pop it into the fridge for it to cool and set down.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph2">
        <ol>
            <p> To make the cheesecake filling:</p>
            <li>With an electric mixer, whisk the cream cheese and icing sugar together until combined well.</li>
            <li>Crush the Oreo biscuits with a food processor. If you don't have that use a rolling pin or any kitchen untensil to help you crush the biscuits. </li>
            <li>Add the crushed oreos into the cream cheese and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the double cream into the cream cheese mixture and whisk it until it's like a mousse like texture. The filling should hold itself when it is ready. </li>
            <li>Lastly tip the cheesecake filling into the pan and smooth it out. Make sure to leave in the fridge for 5-6 hours but if you have the time it will set much better over night.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph2">
        <ol>
            <p>For decoration:</p>
            <li>Remove the cheesecake from the tin, and decorate by drizzling over some melted chocolate.</li>
            <li> Whip up some cream using the double cream and icing sugar and decorate to your liking.</li>
            <li>Use the Oreo biscuits for each slice and then add some crushed oreos in the middle.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph2">
        <p> There you have it, a Oreo Cheesecake which will leave everyone begging for more!</p>
